# Hello-World
Learning To Code

Well hello. This is interesting. Im 18 graduated about a year ago. Im looking for changes and chances for my life. 

Im a bit stuck in everyday life and everyday routine. I hope I can learn to code using Free Code Camp and Github. 
It all sounds interesting and facinating to me what one can do with coding. I have no experience but im willing to do my best and put effort in to learning how to code. I work full time and it sucks but ugh oh well. GGWP Life.
